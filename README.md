# Module-Challenge-02

## Description

Created a portfolio with information about myself and some projects that I have created thus far in the course.
The motiation for creating this portfolio was to make sure that I had experience with creating HTML and advanced CSS files as well as have a deeper understanding of how to setup a website. The problem I needed to solve was to create a page/area where I would be able to upload and keep an updated area of my projects worked on in this coure that I can continually improve. I learnt how to use HTML and CSS together to create a responsive wesbite that is easy to use for users as well as easy to traverse through all the information. 

## Installation
You would need access to Google Chrome or any other web browser to be able ot access and insepct the code of my portfolio website. Other than this there would be no other installation required.
